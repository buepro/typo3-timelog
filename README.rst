===========================
TYPO3 extension ``timelog``
===========================

The extension provides the possibility to register working time in the backend,
organizing it in groups and projects and communicate it to customers. Details
regarding accumulated time can be looked up in the frontend by a token. For
bookkeeping purposes working times can be bundled to batches where each batch
can be referenced by a token too.
