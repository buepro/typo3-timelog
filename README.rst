===========================
TYPO3 extension ``timelog``
===========================

The aim from this extension is to increase the efficiency and transparency of
work by continuously collecting work information and communicate it to
customers.

Work conducted for a project is split into tasks. Each task consists of
intervals where an interval is a timespan work has been conducted to without
interruption. Tasks can be assigned to task groups and further collected in
batches to be used as references (e.g. in in invoices).

With a click information regarding the latest tasks worked on might be
communicated to the client.
