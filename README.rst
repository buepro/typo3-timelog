TYPO3 extension `timelog`
=========================

Following the `introduction chapter <https://docs.typo3.org/p/buepro/typo3-timelog/master/en-us/Introduction/Index.html>`__

The aim from this extension is to increase the efficiency and transparency of work by continuously collecting work
information and communicate it to customers.

Work conducted for a project is split into tasks. Each task consists of intervals where an interval is a
timespan work has been conducted to without interruption. Tasks can be assigned to task groups and further
collected in batches to be used as references (e.g. in in invoices).

With a click information regarding the latest tasks worked on might be communicated to the client.
